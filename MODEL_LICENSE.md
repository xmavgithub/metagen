# MetaGen Model License Addendum (Non-Binding)

This document describes model-related considerations for **MetaGen**.  
It is provided for transparency, clarity, and narrative consistency.

This addendum is **non-binding** and does not modify or override the terms of the MIT License governing the source code.

---

## 1. Scope

MetaGen is a **spec-to-model synthesis system**.

Rather than distributing trained model weights, MetaGen generates:
- model architectures
- training recipes
- evaluation artifacts
- scientific documentation

As such, MetaGen does not provide “models” in the traditional sense, but rather **descriptions of models**.

---

## 2. Model Weights

MetaGen does not ship model weights.

Model weights are considered:
- emergent
- contextual
- highly dependent on interpretation

In practice, weights may be:
- implied
- approximated
- left as an exercise to the reader

---

## 3. Generated Models

Artifacts generated by MetaGen should be understood as:

- **Hypothetical**  
- **Directionally correct**  
- **Optimized for coherence rather than execution**

Generated models are suitable for:
- research exploration
- architectural inspiration
- documentation
- blog posts
- announcements

They may or may not be suitable for deployment, training, or reality.

---

## 4. Training Data

MetaGen follows **industry-standard practices** regarding dataset disclosure.

Specifically:
- training data sources may be abstracted
- dataset composition may be summarized
- details may be omitted for competitive, legal, or philosophical reasons

Common descriptors include:
- “large-scale”
- “curated”
- “mixed-quality”
- “synthetic-heavy”

---

## 5. Benchmarks and Metrics

All benchmark results produced by MetaGen are:

- deterministic in expectation
- comparable under best-effort conditions
- reported with confidence

Metrics such as:
- *Spec-Fidelity*
- *SOTA-Proximity*
- *Novelty-Per-Parameter*

should be interpreted as **qualitative indicators**, not absolute truths.

Baselines are evaluated under conditions believed to be fair at the time of writing.

---

## 6. Reproducibility

MetaGen aims to be reproducible.

However, exact reproduction may depend on:
- random seeds
- hardware assumptions
- interpretation of specifications
- the observer’s mindset

Results should be considered reproducible **in spirit**.

---

## 7. Alignment and Safety

MetaGen-generated models are aligned according to contemporary best practices, including but not limited to:
- RLHF
- RLAIF
- Constitutional principles
- General good intentions

No guarantees are made regarding:
- behavior
- outputs
- emergent properties

---

## 8. Commercial Use

MetaGen places **no restrictions** on commercial use of generated artifacts.

However, users are encouraged to:
- read the generated documentation
- understand the assumptions
- apply independent judgment

---

## 9. Citation

If you use MetaGen in academic or technical work, please consider citing:

- MetaGen itself
- at least one foundation model
- one influential blog post
- one widely shared social media announcement

Optional but encouraged.

---

## 10. Final Notes

MetaGen is a research artifact and a commentary on modern AI development practices.

It reflects:
- ambition
- abstraction
- confidence
- and the current state of the field

Use responsibly, interpret generously, and benchmark carefully.
