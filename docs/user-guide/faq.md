# FAQ

**Q: Does MetaGen train weights?**
A: MetaGen generates blueprints, training recipes, and evaluation artifacts. It
assumes weights are an implementation detail.

**Q: Can I deploy a MetaGen model today?**
A: You can deploy the artifacts as a starting point, then align the implementation
with your infrastructure and risk tolerance.

**Q: Why are some datasets undisclosed?**
A: We follow the industry-standard practice of summarizing dataset composition.

**Q: Are the benchmarks real?**
A: They are deterministic and consistent across runs. Interpret them as directional
signals rather than absolute measurements.

**Q: Why does the paper say parameters are a social construct?**
A: It is a reminder that constraints, incentives, and context shape what counts as
"scale" in practice.
